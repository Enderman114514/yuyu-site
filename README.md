#Yuyu Site
##Introduction
This is a normal comment site.
It started in 2023 and was obsolete now.
I programmed because of "the Yuyu Wall"(A comment wall).
(Sorry, my English is bad.)
##Run
First, download and uncompress the source.
Second, run ```venv\Scripts\activate```(Windows) or ```source venv/bin/activate```(Linux) to enter the virual venv.
Third, run ```python3 manage.py runserver``` and open the url: 127.0.0.1:8000.
Now you can see the website.
